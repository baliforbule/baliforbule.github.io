Selamat Datang di Bali! - this is how you would like to be welcomed on Bali after leaving the plane. Unfortunately, and as on most places on this planet, the reality looks a bit different. By the moment of touchdown you should already have made a number of upcoming decisions: Which visa will I apply for, did I bring goods subject to declaration, should I buy a SIM card, how do I get to my accommodation?

"Bali for Bule" is a somewhat sarcastic title for this website, which was made for you to avoid the most common pitfalls. "Bule" is the Indonesian term for foreigner, which sometimes also has a negative aftertaste.
